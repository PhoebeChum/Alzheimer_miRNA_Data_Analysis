# DA_Assignment

I analyzed NanoString data that I have collected from my Alzheimer's Disease mouse model using RStudio for my Neuroscience, MS course assignment. 

## Description

Total RNA was extracted from the vessels and sent to NanoString for miRNA expression panel. miRNA expression was then analyzed with DESeq2.
Please read NSBB552-Final-Project.pdf for more in-depth study design, packages I used to run the analysis as well as graphs and descriptions of the analysis.
